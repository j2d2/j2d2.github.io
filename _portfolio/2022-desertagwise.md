In partnership with the Yuma Center of Excellence for Desert Agriculture, we created a progressive web app that allows farm operators to better manage waterings for their crops and track the salinity that accumulates in their soil through multiple growing seasons. Utilizing the mathematical models of research scientists from the USDA-ARS and University of Arizona, Desert AgWISE (Water Irrigation Soil Environment) provides crop-specific recommendations for each field as well as other useful data, which will allow the user to make more informed decisions for long-term sustainability.

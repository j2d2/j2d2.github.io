Whoami?
======
J.D. grew up in Tucson, Arizona, with parents inspiring him to think outside the box. He spent his early career learning how to bring new perspectives into large organizations, leveraging his skills in Program Management, Process Engineering and Supply Chain Operations while working with Motorola and Emerson Embedded Computing (now Artesyn Embedded Technologies). This led to becoming Apple’s Operations Program Manager for iPod Touch, bridging Cupertino Engineering to mass-scale manufacturing and supply chain in China.

Throughout his career, he has fed his passions as a Technologist and Software Architect through ventures like AdXplore, and now as Co-Founder of Filmstacker – A video platform to foster creativity and effective storytelling to bring people together.

His extensive developer background includes fluency across the JavaScript spectrum, with roots in C#.NET, as well as technical production in Mobile/Web / iOS / Android, Angular, Ionic, Vue, Graphic / Interaction / Multimedia Design, UI/UX, and ASP.NET Development. Architect & manager of extensive AWS infrastructure including GraphQL, DynamoDB, Biz and Security Layers, middleware & APIs, IOTs, and the full gamut of DevOps. 

Always a proponent of Lean-Agile Best Practices, and finding clever ways to adapt and optimize any process. All while leveraging his Risk Mitigation, planning & strategy experience to build for success. 

Recently engaged with blockchain and the futures of infrastructure, DeFi, and Digitally Scarce Goods (NFTs). Now fascinated with GenAI's impact across markets, and how to leverage and stay ahead of the exponential curve, while exploring AR/VR and building with WebAssembly. Exciting technological times we live in!

Also a Founder at Rhumbline Media, he understands engagement with a film-centric platform and the necessity of storytelling promulgation. J.D. spends his free time with his wife and kids, traveling and immersing himself in cultures around the world and playing music as often as possible.

What is this?
======
**A data-driven personal website**
This website is by me, managed in [this Github repository](https://github.com/j2d2/j2d2.github.io), hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), and built from code automatically using Jekyll when a new commit is made to the repo. 

The beauty of Jekyll is that we can separate the site's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files!

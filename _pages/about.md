# Whoami?

J.D. grew up in Tucson, Arizona, with parents inspiring him to think outside the box. He spent his early career learning how to bring new perspectives into large organizations, leveraging his skills in Project Management, Process Engineering and Supply Chain Operations while working with Motorola and Emerson Embedded Computing (now Artesyn Embedded Technologies).

# What is this?
**A data-driven personal website** by me, managed in [this Github repository](https://github.com/j2d2/j2d2.github.io), hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com), and built from code automatically when a new commit is made to the repo using Jekyll. 

The beauty of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is that we can separate the site's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. You can also modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site, all with the benefits of a Git repo to recover or rollback.

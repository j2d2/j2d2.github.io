J.D. is a software architect and mobile/web application developer with a passion for engaging user experiences, supported by a varied and well-rounded web development and project management career spanning over 15 years. After a BS in Industrial Technology Management from ASU, he developed broad project management experience with high-tech products, requiring very sophisticated software applications. Most recently at Apple as the Operations Product Manager for iPod Touch, where frequent collaboration with the iOS Software Team led to a deep interest and eventual understanding of Apple’s software development cycle and approach - something he often refers to in his own web software projects.

After leaving Apple, he started a mobile web design company and focused on mastering web & mobile technologies, and pushing the limits of mobile experiences to excite clients. He truly enjoys Interaction Design (UI/UX), and much of this passion led him to become the VP of Product and User Experience for a startup app company based in Santa Cruz, CA, before returning to Tucson to become a lead developer for the UA’s CALS CCT Mobile/Web Development team.

This is an industry of constant learning and rapid change, and he truly thrives in this environment, finding great delight in complex challenges requiring creative and innovative solutions.
